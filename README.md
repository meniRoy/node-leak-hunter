# Memory Leak Detection and Prevention in Node.js

## Introduction
This repository provides tools and tips for debugging and preventing memory leaks in Node.js applications. While the focus is on Node.js, many concepts are also applicable to browser-based JavaScript and other languages, especially regarding heap snapshot comparison techniques.

> Note: Some concepts are simplified for clarity. For deeper understanding, please refer to the references section at the end of this document.

## What is a Memory Leak?

A memory leak can be described as:
> "It's like not checking out of a hotel room when you leave. The room remains occupied but unused, preventing other guests from using it until it's freed."

In low-level languages like C, memory leaks occur when allocated memory isn't explicitly released when no longer needed. However, with the invention of garbage collection by John McCarthy, this manual memory management is no longer necessary in many modern languages.

### Garbage Collection Basics

The Garbage Collector (GC) is responsible for:
- Tracking memory that's no longer used by the program
- Reclaiming it for future use
- Releasing memory back to the operating system

The GC considers memory ready for collection when there are no remaining references to it. As long as your program maintains a reference to an object, it won't be collected.

  Our job as developers It's very easy(or at least it seems that way) Don't hold reference to Anything that you don't need anymore 

  So what is a memory leak?

  Usually People calling memory leaks to Describe the situation when A program Consumption of memory grows over time 

  When your memory usage graph look Like Warren Buffett investment portfolio Grass looks like 
   
  The problem in this case is very obvious. If you run your program for long enough, you will get out of memory error

#### 3. **Understanding Memory Leaks in Node.js**
In order to understand, better memory, leaks, and how to handle them first of all, we need to understand how the garbage collector V8 works
 v8 gc Is responsible Deduction of unused Memory And reuse the memory occupied by dead objects

 The algorithm V8 GC (Orinoco) uses is (The tracing algorithm)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection]
 Which basically means In order to know which objects are not in use aka Dead objects and need to be Reclaimed
 We trace a set of root objects Every object that is reachable From those root objects Is an object that can be used by the program and therefore is a alive

 Any other object is a dead object that no one needs anymore

 In a V8, those objects are the stack end global object 
 *** First tip Any object that is attached, directly or indirectly (by his parent or grandparent object) to the global is going to be alive for the entire time of the application, and there for never be released 
Don't attach anything (that you don't actually need) to the global 

Functions in the stack can Hold reference to objects by closure 
If you don't know what closure is, that's the time to go read about that




   
   - **How the Garbage Collector (GC) Works in Node.js**  

   In garbage collection there is an important term: “The Generational Hypothesis”. This basically states that most objects die young. In other words, most objects are allocated and then almost immediately become unreachable, from the perspective of the GC. This holds not only for V8 or JavaScript, but for most dynamic languages.

   Leveraging this fact are two GCs in V8 
     - Minor GC (Scavenger)
     - Major GC (Mark-Compact)Leveraging
    the Scavenger is Quicker And handles only new objects 


    the Major GC Is slower Consume more resources And responsible for the entire heep

the Minor GC runs more often then the majro gc
    
v8 will promote objects, not garbage collected after two Scavenge operations to the old space.

              |                  |

#### 4. **Common Causes of Memory Leaks in Node.js**
   - **Uncleared Listeners and Event Emitters**  
     - Every listenr there in JavaScript is a potential memory leak As long as you don't clear the listener All the objects hold reference by closure And all the objects they are referencing to Will not be collected 

Best practice

Every time you write a listener Also write the code that clear is this listener when it's no longer needed 

Currently the listen, Eric, and all the reference to Some small object
But in the future, someone can attach to this object, bigger object, and you're fucked
   
   - **Global Variables and Caching**  
     - Risks of caching too much data or keeping references to large objects in global scope.
   
   - **Closures and Function Scopes**  
     - Issues arising from closures and retaining variables longer than needed.

#### 7. **Using the Snip3 Hunt Method**
By following this approach, you can significantly improve the clarity of your heap dump comparisons and identify memory leaks more effectively. This methodology provides a structured way to isolate leaks while minimizing noise, making debugging in real-world applications far more manageable.


**Heap Dump Analysis: Challenges and an Improved Approach**

Heap dump analysis can show what is leaking, but it dosnot identify where in the code the issue originates. The biggest challenge in using heap dump comparisons to detect memory leaks is separating useful information from noise.

Anyone who has tried to debug a memory leak in a real-world application using heap dumps knows how difficult it can be to identify what is leaking—even before considering where the leak originates. many advisors suggest the following approach: 

1. Create a snapshot when the application starts.  
2. Run the application for an extended period.  
3. Take another snapshot.  
4. Compare the snapshots to identify the largest leaking objects.

While this method may work for simple examples, it fails in complex, real-world scenarios. 

the reason is that in the exmples the memory snapshots compersion looks like this:  


-- show image of simple meory snapshot comprions  


but in the real world it looks like this  


-- show image of very big heap snapshot comprision


and you will look like this  


-- show image of very Disappointed developer

In practice, after running an application for a few days to "trigger" the memory leak, you often end up with so much noise that it’s nearly impossible to find the root cause. This is the point where some developers resort to quick fixes, such as restarting the server after every 10 calls—a workaround that can even be automated using tools like Kubernetes.

the reason for that is how appliciton memory lif sycle looks like:

Let's look how memories are alocated For the lifetime of our Application

In the beginning, the server allocates a significant amount of memory for initializing objects such as database connections. After the garbage collector (GC) runs, the memory usage is reduced, leaving only the necessary objects.

When the first endpoint is called, additional memory is allocated for initializing various objects. Some of these objects are temporary and will be collected by the GC, while others are retained as they are necessary for the operation of the endpoint.

Additionally, a small memory leak exists. By comparing heap dumps taken immediately after the first GC and the second GC, you can observe the memory leak alongside a significant amount of necessary memory allocations.

This creates a lot of noise in the comparison as we already discussed and it's very hard to Investigate what is the object leakingLet's look how memories are alocated For the lifetime of our Application

However, there is a better solution: analyzing memory allocations throughout the application's lifecycle. Here's how to do it step by step:

### **Improved Memory Leak Detection Approach**

1. **Initial Setup and Noise Reduction**
   - Begin by disabling modules unrelated to the area you're investigating to reduce noise.
   - Start the application and trigger all necessary initialization routines. This ensures all essential objects (e.g., ORM objects, database connections, WebSocket handlers, background workers, etc.) are allocated.

2. **First Heap Dump**
   - Run the garbage collector (GC) to clean up unnecessary objects.
   - Take the first heap dump, which will represent the memory state immediately after initialization.

3. **Targeted Leak Triggering**
   - Focus on a specific area of the system that you suspect is leaking. Trigger this area multiple times to make the leak more noticeable.
   - Run the GC again to clean up temporary allocations, and take the second heap dump.

4. **Third Heap Dump for Noise Reduction**
   - Wait for a minute or more to allow temporary allocations to stabilize.
   - Trigger the GC once more to collect all temporary memory allocated between snapshots 1 and 2.
   - Take a third heap dump.

5. **Comparison for Leak Identification**
   - Compare memory allocations between snapshot 1 and snapshot 2. Identify memory that was allocated but not removed by the GC in snapshot 3.
   - This method filters out 99% of the noise caused by temporary allocations, leaving only the true memory leak.
